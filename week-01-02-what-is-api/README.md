# Week 1-2: Introduction to APIs

## Overview

In these first two weeks, we'll build a solid foundation in API concepts through practical, hands-on examples and real-world analogies. By the end, you'll understand what APIs are, how they work, and be able to build a simple API using Python.

## Learning Objectives

1. Understand what an API is and why we use them
2. Learn about HTTP methods and their purposes
3. Understand request-response patterns
4. Build a simple API using Python dictionaries

## Folder Structure

- `examples/`: Contains example code demonstrating key concepts
  - `basic-dictionary-api.py`: Simple API implementation using dictionaries
  - `restaurant-api-metaphor.py`: API concepts explained through a restaurant analogy

- `exercises/`: Practice assignments to reinforce learning
  - `exercise-1.md`: Contact List API implementation
  - `exercise-2.md`: Restaurant Order System API

- `lessons/`: Detailed explanations of concepts
  - `01-api-basics.md`: Introduction to API concepts
  - `02-http-methods.md`: Understanding HTTP methods
  - `03-request-response.md`: Deep dive into requests and responses

- `mini-project/`: Week's culminating project
  - `README.md`: Project requirements and instructions
  - `starter-code/`: Template code to begin with
  - `solution/`: Complete implementation (for reference)
  - `tests/`: Test cases for your implementation

## Getting Started

1. Read through the lessons in order:
   - Start with `01-api-basics.md`
   - Move on to `02-http-methods.md`
   - Finally, cover `03-request-response.md`

2. Experiment with the examples:
   - Run and modify `basic-dictionary-api.py`
   - Understand the analogy in `restaurant-api-metaphor.py`

3. Complete the exercises:
   - Build the Contact List API (Exercise 1)
   - Implement the Restaurant System (Exercise 2)

4. Take on the mini-project:
   - Read the project requirements
   - Start with the provided template
   - Implement your solution
   - Run the tests to verify your work
